a short description of the area, and a reason for choice.:
The input OpenStreetMap dataset was chosen for the Seattle, Washington area. This was chosen due to personal interest 
in the area (i.e., interest in potential immigration) after a weekend that was recently spent there. 
For these purposes, quality of life considerations are chosen for exploration with the goal of getting an idea of 
the types of amenities and entertainment available in the area (massive assumption exists in that an adequate work 
opportunity is found for employment).
